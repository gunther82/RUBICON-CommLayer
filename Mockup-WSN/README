Compile the TinyOS application with:
"make telosb"

If it mentions something about the following:
"
> symbol  : class SerialPacket
> location: class net.tinyos.message.Message
>   private SerialPacket serialPacket;
>           ^
> /opt/tinyos-2.1.1/support/sdk/java/net/tinyos/message/Message.java:676: cannot find symbol
"

Then you don't have your classpath properly set. Try the following:

"export CLASSPATH=.:/opt/tinyos-2.1.1/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar"

Then restart the bash session for good luck.

then flash it on the motes with:
"make telosb reinstall.NODE_ID bsl,YOUR_SERIAL_PORT"


where NODE_ID is the identifier of the mote (IMPORTANT: 0 for the sink)
to see your serial port type:
"motelist"

Compile the java application (SerialReader.java) to send command to the sink and to get the read values with:
"javac SerialReader.java"

and then connect the sink to the USB port of your base station and run the java application with:
"java SerialReader -comm serial@YOUR_SERIAL_PORT:telosb"


You maybe faced with the following problem:

"
The toscomm JNI library was not found.
Check that your tinyos-tools package is installed and try
rerunning tos-install-jni.
Aborting.
"

Just run:

"
sudo tos-install-jni
"

The red led blinking means a readio transmission has been executed.
On the other motes: 
- the blu led ON means that the on-demand read modality with random delay is active
- the green led ON means that the on-demand read modality with fixed delay is active
